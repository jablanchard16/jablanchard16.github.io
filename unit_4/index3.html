<h1>What we do:</h1>
<hr width="75%"> 
<p>Rent Your Roster was founded to provide sports fans of all levels to enjoy watching their team in style at an affordable price. It&#39s expensive enough to go see your team play with marked up ticket prices and $10 beers - this is where we come in.

Whether your wardrobe is lacking an authentic jersey, or you&#39re trying to change the playoff mojo with some new apparel, Rent Your Roster provides a cost-friendly solution to sporting a new, authentic jersey for a fraction of the price.</p>
